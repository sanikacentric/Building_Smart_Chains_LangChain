    "#Intelligent agents, also known as AI agents, are preemptive agents that perform certain actions to achieve predefined goals. They extend the concept of conventional agents by not only responding but also acting preemptively, making decisions, and taking actions over an extended period. These AI agents can range from simple systems like a thermostat to more complex beings like humans or even larger systems such as firms, states, or biomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The behavior of these intelligent agents is driven by an objective function that encapsulates their targets. They function with the aim of maximizing the expected value of this objective function. Notable examples include a reinforcement learning agent guided by a reward function, and an evolutionary algorithm steered by a fitness function. The reward function for the reinforcement learning agent plays a crucial role by allowing programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, the fitness function acts as the steering wheel for an evolutionary algorithm's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The paradigms of intelligent agents are probed in various fields such as cognitive science, ethics, philosophy, and computer social simulations. These agents are often described in abstract terms, making them highly similar to computer programs. This schematic description often results in them being referred to as abstract intelligent agents or, borrowing a term from economics, \"rational agents\". Also, they have a close relation to software agents, which are autonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users. Such software agents are another key application of the concept of intelligent agents"
